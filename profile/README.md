## About

Alkane Framework is a modern C++ graphics and physics engine built on OpenGL, designed for performance, simplicity, and flexibility. It enables developers to create interactive simulations and games with minimal overhead, while providing the tools to extend and customize functionality.

## Contributing

This is currently a solo project, but contributions are welcome:

* Report bugs or request features via Issues
* Submit improvements or examples via Pull Requests
* Discuss ideas or enhancements in Discussions

## Resources
I have not yet written anything about the documentation as I'm thinking I'll complete the engine first and then start on the docs!
You can still get some info by the default examples.
